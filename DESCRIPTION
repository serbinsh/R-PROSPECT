Description: A package containing R functions for running the PROSPECT family
    of leaf radiative transfer models (RTMs). This package also includes
    functions for inverting the PROSPECT models with measured reflectance and 
    transmittance spectra (using the DEoptim algorithm) to obtain estimates of 
    leaf parameters (e.g. Chlorophyll, leaf mass per area).
